    "I first explored different architecture networks such as VGG and ResNet, and I chose the model with the best performance. In my opinion, ResNet is well-suited for this problem because it is based on a convolutional architecture, which is particularly effective for image classification tasks. Additionally, ResNet introduced the concept of skip connections, which helps to address the issue of vanishing gradients and allows for the successful training of deeper networks. This concept of skip connections greatly improves the accuracy of ResNet, especially when compared to models like VGG, which may struggle with deeper architectures."
